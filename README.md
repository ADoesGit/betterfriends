# Better Friends
Powercord plugin that aims to improve Discord's friend feature

## This plugin is a work in progress
Although fairly stable and despite the fact that *most* modules are functional, some features may not be working as intended, or will change in the future.
If you have found a bug, feel free to report it on the issues tab.

## Installation
Provided you have installed and injected Powercord correctly (see [here](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord/wiki/Installation) for instructions)

`1.` Clone the repo into your Powercord plugins folder (found in `powercord/src/Powercord/plugins`)

`2.` CTRL+R in your canary client to restart.

## So, what does this do?
Glad you asked. Essentially, this plugin allows you to *favorite* friends. 
How are favorited friends different to normal friends you ask? Here is the current list of features (with more to come in the future):

* [See status changes live in the bottom right hand corner](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/ZDW25DI9.gif)
* [Adds a little star emoji next to their name](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/QhzivMAb.png)
* [Entirely new section in the DMs area that will prioritize DMs from favorited friends](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/f11PuwZH.png)
* [See when and where your favorite friends were last active](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/DOZPdrTn.mp4)
* [Special "Favorited" tab inside of the "Friends" section to see all of your favorited friends at once](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/Lp76IzAp.png)
* Special notification sounds for favorited friends

**Integrations with other Powercord plugins:**

* [Integration with `pc-spotify` to listen along with your friends if they're listening to Spotify](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/tCO7Kn55.mp4)
* Integration with [`channel-typing`](https://github.com/powercord-community/channel-typing) to see [when favorited friends are typing in a channel](https://massive-legend.nevulo.xyz/qECqhbxp.png)
